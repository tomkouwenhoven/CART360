          <p>I walked around my apartment and just tested basically every  object on their electrical properties.  This resulted in finding multiple rather different objects. They all are conductive and but besides that they do not have a lot in common. This can be an advantage as it keeps my scope open to different projects. The table below shows four objects with their corresponding affordances. These can become useful when designing an interface.</p>

          <p>My first intention was to start working with either keys or the bracelet. However they are relatively small objects which you can only use to close an electrical circuit. In case of the golden ring this means that a user needs to connect his finger with an electrical signal, I assume that people would not be comfortable with this idea. The keys could be used to initiate some binary response either at the door or somewhere in the house(e.g. switch on a light). However, this would again mean that a user is in touch with the electrical circuit. </p>
          <p>As I am from the Netherlands and obviously we bike a lot I decided to continue and create a project with the braking system of a bike. The main idea of the project is to notify other road users of braking bikes. This especially holds when biking during the night and it can be compared with braking lights on cars. Whenever a car stops, braking lights brighten up. </p>
          <p>However there might be side effects to this light. Typically, what happens when the light gets switched on by accident? Or how long should the braking effect be visible? What’s to do with social norms, what if people (unnecessary) brake to often and the brake light becomes distracting? These are questions which should be investigated and maybe even tested during a regulated test period. </p>

          <h3>
              <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Description Interface 
          </h3>
          <p>In my opinion one of the most promising features of this project is the interface. When this project gets integrated into our everyday bikes there is nothing a user needs to do. It would seemingly operate without a user even realizing. There are no screens or buttons which a user needs to use, this enlarges the usability and in my opinion also the user experience (this assumption needs examination). The only physical input a user has would be the actual rear brake. This interaction on it self is really simple too, there are two options, brake or not brake. These options are obviously natural and which again simplifies the interface. </p>
          <p>During this project the actual brake is mimicked by a transistor. In order for this braking light to be effective it needs to be easily installed. Additionally, it needs to have a universal fit. Also the light needs to be rather small, or at least it should not disrupt the bike design too much. A normal bike already has a backlight so position-wise, this should be a good spot to ad a braking light. Another pro of this position; it’s easy to attach a cable from the light to the braking cable(which then closes the circuit from brake to light). </p>
          <p>The front part must be mimicked during this project as well, ideally you want it to be integrated into your brake but this won’t be able for now. There are many future extensions possible on this aspect. One can think of brain controlled backlights or maybe even brain controlled braking. For example: a helmet which sense your brains and detect a future braking action, it can send a signal to a connected braking light or even stop the bike. </p>
          <h3>
              <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Storyboard
          </h3>
          <p>Image yourself biking on the streets, you have to brake for a red light or a car crossing you. </p>
          <p>Your natural response would be braking, obviously this reaction won’t change but now a capacitor releases its energy onto a (set of ) red LED(s) on the back of your bike. This will generate the desired effect of a braking light. Depending on the capacitor this will only last for a short amount of time. After the braking period the electrical circuit would charge the capacitor again for a next braking action. This whole process will be non-obtrusive for the you even though it is initiated by yourself. </p>
          <p>Green light so you can start riding again. Release your brake and the next stop you’ll brake again. This will generate the same effect. </p>
          <p>A few contextual aspects can be derived from this scenario. Firstly, the spatial context, as described earlier the product will be used outside and will especially be active on the road. This brings me to the temporal context, it will on average be used for short/mid-long periods when biking. However, it needs to robust and have a long lifespan. The braking light increases social context as people get more aware of (fellow) cyclists. On the other side, as mentioned earlier, it can also become distracting which could possibly lead to more interpersonal tension on the roads. </p>
          
          <h3>
              <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Schematic of circuit
          </h3>
          
          <p>The electrical circuit is rather simple. This is an advantage as it might be more robust towards usage. Additionally, users can easliy alter the light if needed. A double pole switch determines wheather the capacitor is being charged or drained. This results in a couple of LEDs turned (temporarely) on or off. A schematic figure can be seen in the following picture. </p>
