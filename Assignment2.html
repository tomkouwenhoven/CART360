                <p>Multiple sensors have been looked into. Most of the time we had some struggles with objectively looking at parts. Before we even noticed we were thinking: “How could we use this?” We believe that this is not the right approach, one needs to start looking for cool sensors regardless of its functions. Our research resulted in the following analog sensors.

                            <p>The flex sensor is an analog sensor which is using flexibility to determine the amount of resistance. The documentation states that the resistance ranges from 30k ohm to 50-70k ohm. However, with use of the multimeter we discovered this range is different. The flex sensor comes in two sizes (2.2 and 4,5 inch). The sensors were available in the lab so we were able to play a little with them. We observed that the sensor needs a specific type of bendage in order to deliver usable results. Specific as in not bending it at the ‘stem’ but at the actual sensing part. This is important because only then the sensor outputs correct readings. According to the documentation the sensor works between 0°  (flat) and 90°. We found that it gives output when bending further than this stated threshold. A possible problem for us to occur when using this sensor is that the shape is not persistent. The sensor will probably slowly shaped to a position which is used the most.

                            <p>The sensor generates a voltage when being flexed, shocked or touched. The voltage output for the piezo sensor can be as much as 90 volts. We hooked a piece of piezo film to the arduino and observed what happened. The sensor, while being flexed -intensively- , generated a very low voltage output. This made the sensor useless for us. However, when this output is high enough one could think about creating a self-sufficient device which does not take a negative load on the environment. </p>

                <h5>Heartbeat Sensor</h5>
<p>We really liked the idea of creating something wearable which allows us to manipulate stimuli over time. Our aim in the research was that the sensor could be incorporated in a wearable object. The easiest element of our research was the heartbeat sensor. The sensor should be placed on one's thumb or earlobe. With the heart rate as input we could think of an exercise buddy who supports your run through the park by always playing the right bpm song. However, we disliked the fact that the sensor only can be used for measuring the heartbeat. We wanted to create our own sensor-context instead of already having the context of where it should be used. 
</p>            
                <h5>Flex sensor wearable</h5>
<p>We decided to work with the flex sensor. The sensor which is thoroughly described in the research. We really liked the idea to incorporate one or more flex sensors to the hand. The flex sensor can be easily manipulated by attaching it to the fingers. When doing this the user has the ability to manipulate the full range of degrees (0 - 90). The analog data could be used in numerous ways. For example one can think of controlling RGB light with three fingers, where each fingers represents the amount of red, green, and blue. However, we failed to correctly implement the assignments time element. Therefore we decided to do something else with the flex sensor.

                <h5>Flex sensor plant</h5>
<p>Then it came to mind to attach the flex sensor to a plant. It happens that a plant or flower does not get enough water. Whenever this happens the plant starts to ‘collide’ to a side because it is being weakened. When attaching a flex sensor to a plant we can determine if the plant isn’t straight anymore. The output could be light or sound in order to remind the owner of it’s dying plant.

                <h5>Flex sensor wind</h5>
<p>The same flex sensors do not only use human input, because they “sense” bending, it can also be used to sense other objects. This fact opened a whole new range of implementations which brought us to the current idea. The image below will be our project, it is thouroughly explained in the next section.</p>

          </h3>
            <p>In the end we decided to do something with weather, in particular wind. We came up with an idea of mapping colors (RGB) to wind intensity. One should think of this as a couple of large bendable poles which are able to sense the intensity of the wind. These poles are designed as objects and can be placed on a square or public area. Whenever the wind blows the poles act as mysterious tall waving objects to generate curiosity of bystanders. Whenever the poles wave in the wind, light begins to change colours accordingly to the intensity of the wind. This can be thought of as an easy accessible visualisation of the weather. While the physical poles are visibly waving in the wind the visual manifestation of light changes continuously, another attractive feature. As said before it is there to generate a mysterious feeling of curiosity (e.g. why are the lights changing their colors?). Initially, the object should cause a wow feeling, it should surprise people. However a short time of investigating should be enough to understand that wind is the cause for the lights to change color. 
</p>
            <p>The idea is that whenever it is cold, the light tries to warm you up with different shades of red light. When more people get attracted to the mimicked feeling of warmth, the group starts to grow. The warm light starts a proces in where people are going to feel more coherently to each other. Imagine yourself walking down a square. Few simple white poles attract your attention and you look to its origin and see a warm red/orange light glowing. Obviously you want to know what’s going on and you walk towards the poles, it happens that more people are interested and a small gathering is going on. The same principle can be used for warm summer times, the light will emit blue tinted light to ‘cool’ the people around it.

            <p>The final idea has been implemented using an arduino UNO and two breadboards. They are neatly built into a small maquette which represents a square. The schematic for all the integrated tech can be seen in the picture below. </p>

            <p>There are two main analog sensors, a LM35 temperature sensor, and a SEN-10264 flex sensor. The temperature sensor generates a greater voltage when it gets warmer and the flex sensor increases its resistance the more it is bend. As pointed out in the research the flex sensor can only bend in one specific way, thus needs to be carefully used. This sensor is powered by the 5 voltage output of the Arduino UNO. Because the resistance of the SEN-10264 varies much (see specifications) another resistor is needed. In our project we used a 10kΩ (pulldown) resistor to make sure there wouldn’t be too much current flowing through our circuit.</p>
            
            <p>An arduino is used to receive the input from both sensors and do some calculations. It basically maps certain bends to certain green values(0...255), it does this in combination with a 255 red or blue value to generate a variety of red and blue shades. </p>
            
            <p>In the current implementation the LM35 temperature sensor determines whether it is winter or summer time. One could therefore argue that this sensor is the primary input. The temperature sensor has three pins, each with a different function. It needs a 5 Volt input which can be generated by the Arduino UNO, it has a ground pin and an analog output pin which is connected back to the Arduino. </p>
            
            <p>Depending on the seasons, which for now only include summer or winter, the red or blue value is pumped up to 255. For example, during winter, the blue value will be zero whereas the red value will automatically be 255. Note: There are future possibilities here such as changing the red value according to data gathered over the years. </p>
            
            <p>The output, which is a RGB LED, can be used in multiple ways. Like described before, to enlighten a pole, or a whole square. One can also think of applications where the outside placed poles generate inside wind sounds so make a (e.g.) big market building feel more natural. A RGB LED does not like too much current, therefore every pin is connected with power after a 220Ω resistor. </p>

            <p>All flex sensors tend to have differences in their raw analog values. Therefore we wrote a little program to calibrate each sensor. These values need to be considered as every sensor will be connected to the RGB LEDs and these values need to be within range(0...255).

            <h5>Tom about Jurre</h5>
            <p>Jurre and I have been working together for a long time, this means that we know how to get along and organize projects pretty well. Just as always, we’ve had some struggles with coming up with an idea which we both liked. Even so we’ve been arguing about different implementations but I always see this as a good thing, it gets you involved even more. </p>

<p>Jurre has made the entire marquette and the storyboards, we’ve had a little discussion about it but he is the creative guy between us two. I usually am more practical and into programming. Therefore I’ve made this my little project, of course there’s always a lot of discussion going on, mainly on how the programming extends or limits our ideas. This is where we both go into the coding and figure out a way to minimize losses/gain extensions.</p>

<p>We both worked equally much on the documentation, this means: we not only generate text. More importantly we check each other's work and where needed we change it. This brings me to the next thing, whenever we’re checking each other, new ideas or completely different meanings about the project arise. Most of the time we start sparring about this and find a common road to continue on, another good thing as it improves involvement. 
</p>
            
            <h5>Jurre about Tom</h5>
            <p>Tom and I have been working together for a long time, which works well because apparently we can get stuff done. We both know our (in)capabilities well and rely upon each other in solving issues. Unfortunately this project just came in a very busy time for me. In the week of the deadline I had 3 other deadlines and on top of that my family was visiting me. Basically this week was trying to be at 2 places at once and doing 3 times at the same time. Unfortunately my folks from the Netherlands were a bit too much.</p> 

<p>However this project was fun to do because we had a cool and viable idea.  The concept was easy understandable and we were able to think in pseudocode. We both understand how to code but since I had not much time Tom did the coding. Whenever we ran in problems code- or concept wise we figured how to solve it together. Since tom did the coding, I took the physical part of the project on me. </p>

<p>We both worked a lot on documentation. Almost our entire process of thought is written down on this website. We always write in google docs because that makes it easy to constantly improve each other's texts.
