                <p>Multiple sensors have been looked into. Most of the time we had some struggles with objectively looking at parts. Before we noticed we were thinking: “How could we use this?” We believe that this is not the right approach, one needs to start looking for cool objects regardless of its functions. Lots of searching resulted in the following analog sensors.

                            <p>The flex sensor is an analog sensor which is using flexibility to determine the amount of resistance. The documentation states that the resistance ranges from 30k ohm to 50-70k ohm. However, with use of the multimeter we discovered this range is different. The flex sensor comes in two sizes (2.2 and 4,5 inch). The sensors are available in the lab so we were able to play a little with them. We observed that the sensor needs a specific type of bendage in order to deliver usable results. Specific as in not bending it at the ‘stem’ but at the actual sensing part. This is important because only then the sensor outputs correct readings. According to the documentation the sensor works between 0°  (flat) and 90°. We found that it gives output when bending further than this stated threshold. A possible problem for us to occur when using this sensor is that the shape is not persistent. The sensor will probably slowly shaped to a position which is used the most.

                <p>Heartbeat Sensor<br>
We really liked the idea of creating something wearable which allows us to manipulate stimuli over time. Our aim in the research was that the sensor could be incorporated in a wearable object. The easiest element of our research was the heartbeat sensor. The sensor should be placed on one's thumb or earlobe. With the heart rate as input we could think of an exercise buddy who supports your run through the park by always playing the right bpm song. However, we disliked the fact that the sensor only can be used for measuring the heartbeat. We wanted to create our own sensor-context instead of already having the context of where it should be used. 
</p>
                <p>Flex sensor wearable<br>
We decided to work with the flex sensor. The sensor which is thoroughly described in the research. We really liked the idea to incorporate one or more flex sensors to the hand. The flex sensor can be easily manipulated by attaching it to the a finger. When doing this the user has the ability to use the full range of degrees (0 - 90). The analog data could be used in numerous ways. For example one can think of controlling RGB light with three fingers, where each fingers represents the amount of red, green, and blue. However, we failed to correctly implement the assignments time element. Therefore we decided to do something else with the flex sensor.
</p>
                <p>Flex sensor plant<br>
Then it came to mind to attach the flex sensor to a plant. It happens that a plant or flower does not get enough water. Whenever this happens the plant starts to ‘collide’ to a side because it is being weakened. When attaching a flex sensor to a plant we can determine if the plant isn’t straight anymore. The output could be light or sound in order to remind the owner of it’s dying plant.
</p>
                <p>Flex sensor wind<br>
The same flex sensors do not only use human input, because they “sense” bending, it can also be used apart from human beings. This fact opened a whole new range of implementations which brought us to the current idea. </p>

            <h3>
              <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Description Interface 
          </h3>
            <p>In the end we decided to do something with weather, in particular with wind. We came up with an idea of mapping colors (RGB) to wind intensity. One should think of this as a couple of large bendable poles which are able to sense the intensity of the wind. These poles are designed as objects and can be placed on a square or public area. Whenever the wind blows the poles act as mysterious tall waving objects to generate curiosity of bystanders. Whenever the poles wave in the wind, light begins to change colours accordingly to the intensity of the wind. This can be thought of as an easy accessible visualisation of the weather. While the physical poles are visibly waving in the wind the visual manifestation of light changes continuously, another attractive feature. As said before it is there to generate a mysterious feeling of curiosity (e.g. why are the lights changing their colors?). Initially, the object should cause a wow feeling, it should surprise people. However a short time of investigating should be enough to understand that wind is the cause for the lights to change color. 
</p>
            <p>The idea is that whenever it is cold, the light tries to warm you up with different shades of red light. As more people get attracted to this mimicked feeling of warmth the group around the light starts to grow. The warm light starts a proces in where people are going to feel more coherently to each other. Few simple white poles attract your attention and you look to its origin and see a warm red/orange light glowing. Obviously you want to know what’s going on and you walk towards the poles, it happens that more people are interested and a small gathering is going on. The same principle can be used for warm summer times, the light will emit blue tinted light to ‘cool’ the people around it.

          </h3> 
            
            <p>The final idea has been implemented using an arduino UNO and two breadboards. They are neatly built into a small maquette which represents a square. The schematic for all the integrated tech can be seen in the picture below. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>There are two main analog sensors, a LM35 temperature sensor, and a SEN-10264 flex sensor. The temperature sensor uses generates a greater voltage when it gets warmer and the flex sensor increases its resistance the more it is bend. As pointed out in the research the flex sensor can only bend in one specific way, thus needs to be carefully used. This sensor is powered by the 3.3 voltage output of the Arduino UNO. Because the resistance of the SEN-10264 varies much (see specifications) another resistor is needed. In our project we used a 10kΩ resistor to make sure there wouldn’t be too much current flowing through our circuit.</p>
            
            <p>An arduino is used to receive the input from both sensors and do some calculations. It basically maps certain bends to certain green values(0...255), it does this in combination with a 255 red or blue value to generate a variety of red and blue shades. </p>
            
            <p>In the current implementation the LM35 temperature sensor determines whether it is winter or summer time. One could therefore argue that this sensor is the primary input. The temperature sensor has three pins, each with a different function. It needs a 5 Volt input which can be generated by the Arduino UNO, it has a ground pin and an analog output pin which is connected back to the Arduino. </p>
            
            <p>Depending on the seasons, which for now only include summer or winter, the red or blue value is pumped up to 255. For example, during winter, the blue value will be zero whereas the red value will automatically be 255. Note: There are future possibilities here such as changing the red value according to data gathered over the years. </p>
            
            <p>The output, which is a RGB LED, can be used in multiple ways. Like described before, to enlighten a pole, or a whole square. One can also think of applications where the outside placed poles generate inside wind sounds so make a (e.g.) big market building feel more natural. A RGB LED does not like too much current, therefore every pin is connected with power after a 220Ω resistor. </p>
