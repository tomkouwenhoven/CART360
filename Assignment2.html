                <p>I walked around my apartment and basicly just tested every object on their electrical properties. This resulted in finding multiple but rather different objects. They all are conductive but besides that they do not have a lot in common. This can be an advantage as it keeps my option open. The table below shows four objects with their corresponding affordances. These can become useful when designing an interface.</p>

                <p>My first intention was to start working with either keys or the bracelet. However they are relatively small objects which you can only use close to an electrical circuit. In case of the golden ring this means that a user needs to connect his finger with an electrical signal, I assume that people would not be comfortable with this idea. The keys could be used to initiate some binary response either at the door or somewhere in the house(e.g. switch on a light). However, this would again mean that a user is in touch with the electrical circuit.</p>
                <p>As I am from the Netherlands and obviously we bike a lot I decided to continue and create a project with the braking system of a bike. The main idea of the project is to notify other road users of braking cyclists. This especially holds when biking during the night and it can be compared with braking lights on cars. Whenever a car stops, braking lights brighten up.</p>
                <p>However there might be side effects to this light. Typically, what happens when the light gets switched on by accident? Or how long should the braking effect be visible? What to do with social norms, what if people (unnecessary) brake to often and the brake light becomes distracting? These are questions which should be investigated and maybe even tested during a regulated test period.</p>
