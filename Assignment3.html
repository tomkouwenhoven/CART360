                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>Planet earth is a continuous changing world. An infinite amount of events happen and change every moment of time. Over time these changes have some sort of impact on the world. These impacts have a positive impact on life. But every coin has a flipside, and life can not be purely about the manifestation of good things in entities. Negative and bad events happen in every moment of time. These events can be uncontrolled, unnoticed and even invisible. The downside of these negative invisible events is that people forget or even not know about those. This notion of (un)knowledge is concerning. This project is going to actively start changing the world, it’s going to raise awareness of all these invisible events that have a negative impact on earth’s environment. 
</p>
                <p>We’ve created a physical object which measures the cycling activity. It is going to use an accelerometer/gyroscope to measure if someone is biking. Whenever a person finished biking we will know how long the cycling was and therefore we can calculate the amount of emission that has been saved. This is all transmitted to a database which stores the amount of cyclists and their data. The more people chose to use their bikes, the more emission was saved. This notion will be represented in the real world by lighting up a building. The initial representation of a day with a lot of emission will be a negative color projected on the building. As more emission is been saved, the representation will be more positive. This notion should create a feeling that a community is working together for a greener earth.
</p>
                <h5>Think of a context and an environment where you would like to intervene. Where will you present your project? Who is it made for?</h5>
                <p>We want to focus on the invisible, daily emission which is created by motorized transportation all over Montreal (and all over the world). The negative effects of emission are an undisputed truth, but fail to be accepted and transformed in preventional measures. Most of people continue with their environmental disastrous behavior even though they have the emission problem somewhere in mind . It almost seems that the world want to somehow kill itself because motorized transportation still is increasing every moment in time. Could that be because the emission problem is too difficult to grasp? </p>
                <p>What if it is possible to make these ungraspable, invisible events visually present in the public environment. A visual representation of people's impact on their environment. A representation which makes everyone aware because the stimuli cannot go unnoticed. For now think of widely used squares, prominent buildings and other landmarks which could function as the real-time visualization of the invisible bad things that humans do to their environment. </p>
                <p>But it can not be only about emission which is created by motorized transportation. To contribute to a better environment people also have to be willing to act and create a better world. Our focus will be on manual/mechanical versus motorized transportation. The more people choose to take their bikes, the carbon dioxide will be emitted. Which in turn may even result in a more green environment. </p>
                <h5>Think about the kind of relationship you wish to foster between your users and the artifact or installation. How can you use your project to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?</h5>
                <p>Making a direct relationship to daily transport and a visual artifact creates a link between behavior and a visual stimuli. The purpose of the project is creating public awareness about their daily lives. The ultimate goal is to try and build a more close relationship between people and their city/environment. Cities are not only there to live in, but also to take care of. Additionally the project creates an active involvement between inhabitants and their city. </p>
                <p>As stated earlier this can be done by creating a direct relationship between environmental waste and human behavior. For example people who are getting from A to B by using non-emissive ways of transportation literally contribute to a more healthy body and city. By directly transforming their (environmental friendly) actions to the visual and graspable world they might get a feeling of contributing to a better city. However, this project should also focus on the negative events. The city could literally be more ugly whenever too many cars produce too much emission. By doing this car drivers will hopefully feel the consequences from their “bad” behavior. </p>
                <p>By making the behavioral effects on the environment going both ways this project will hopefully let people actively reflect on their good or bad behavior.</p>
                <h5>Think about the notion of empowerment. Is your artifact really helping or challenging its users in any way or is it just another psychological prosthesis?
</h5>
                <p>By implementing the project in a city like Montreal we can make people aware of the relationship of their behavior and the environment of their beloved city. The project can have an either a bad or a good effect on how the city is going to look. We give the users a possibility to build on how pleasing their city is going to be. Again, the main purpose is to create awareness. Finally, a growing movement should appear, one that challenges people other people to care about their environment. </p>
                <h5>Think about something meaningful. What are you trying to tell us with your project?</h5>
                <p>As stated earlier, the human race is beginning to transform the earth. Take for example high density, over-populated areas like Singapore and the Netherlands. In these areas you hard to find authentic nature, untouched by humans. And the last couple of centuries the we’ve been asking a lot more of nature. We are asking so much that nature soon will not be able to help us provide our needs anymore. The ecological footprint of the human race is out of bounds. Next generations will probably suffer from the consequences of our destructive behavior. This has to be changed and hopefully can be changed by letting our actions have an immediate effect on our environment. The purpose of this project is to create awareness about the seemingly invisible relationship between human behaviour and the state of nature. </p>

            <h3>
              <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Research in three similar papers
          </h3>
            <p>Multiple other initiatives are decribed in the following section.</p>
            <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car-Free_Days">Car free sunday</a></h5>
            <p>In 1939 the Netherlands introduced a car free sunday. This meant that no motorized vehicle was allowed to drive on the dutch streets. This resulted in a vast amount of people walking on public streets and even on the highways. It is still in practice, although there is a single day during the european mobility week every year where every city can choose to participate. The initial intention wasn’t to make people aware of vehicle emission, it was initiated because of petrol shortages. However, nowadays it’s something to make people aware, we can still do without our cars, we can also take our bikes, or even walk to the supermarket. This day is widely accepted and embraced, it does really create a sense of cohesion. This is one of the things which our project is trying to aim for. </p>
            <h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCKEFbBmadg">Media</a></h5>
            <p>The media plays a huge roll in environmental change as well. Think about the controversy displayed by different “high status” people in the media. One objective example is the lately released movie ‘before the flood’ by Leonardo di Caprio. He gives a perspective on where the earth is going, and even more shocking what people are NOT doing. More importantly, he’s showing what we should do. Another example is ‘The inconvenient truth’ by Al gore. In this presentation/documentary Al gore is throwing with facts and tries to scare people about our current direction. The makers obviously try to motivate people to reflect on their behavior and act differently/accordingly. One can argue that a movie does not have the desired effects, but we will get back to that later. </p>
            <h5><a href="">3rd research</a></h5>
            <h5><a href="">Our project</a></h5>
            <p>These projects basically all share the same ultimate goal: save the world from it’s ending, create awareness about the environment and change people's behavior. Most of this is done by using facts about carbon dioxide, temperature rise and shocking images. However, as mentioned earlier, one can argue the effectiveness of movies. Speech is can be an effective way of convincing, but it can also just be a nice speech, without any desired results. Our project is based on facts, but it won’t use these to convince people to take their bikes. We’re trying to create a community/movement and represent this to the world. A community that actively chooses to commute by bike instead of cars, a community of which it’s participants together paint/cover a building in a green color, a community that creates a cleaner city. Additionally, we’re creating a physical object, this will open the possibility for others to see who’s participating in the movement. There will also be a sense of coherence as participants can also identify other participants. They will immediately generate some sense of relationship. These two features will be different from existing projects. </p>
            <h3>
              <span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Other projects
          </h3>
            <h5>The space project/festival buddy
</h5>
            <p>What - Tech enhanced hats which visualize people their personal space with light. For some people creating personal space could be important. Visualization of personality in some way
                <br> How - Ultrasound/ proximity meters to determine the person his personal space. Leds have a lighting pattern according to the person his personal space.
                <br> Explorations - The hats is not solely about creating an individual his personal space. Creating a network of communicating hats (XBEE) to visualize person their individual/personal life. </p>
            <h5>Bike helmet</h5>
            <p>What - Tech enhanced bike helmet which acts like a 3rd eye. Cars start to have smart systems which prevent accidents. Until now, this functionality failed to enter the world of bicycles. With an environmental conscious helmet cyclists could have some sort of extra reliance when biking through big cities like Montreal and New York
                <br> How - Bunch of sensors can be integrated in the helmet. Basically our vision as an end product is bringing the world of smart cars to a biking helmet.
                <br> Explorations - If viable, this product can be part of the drive smart line. </p>
            <h5>Realtime data visualisation bike vs emission
</h5>
            <p>What - Emission and fumes are invisible for the eye but bad for the environment. With a real time data visualisation which maps the environmental state on the actual public environment (e.g. buildings, squares etc..) this issue is projected to create public awareness.
                <br> How - Actively log environmental relevant data which can be used to realtime project the state of the environment.
                <br> Explorations - Physical visualization of data on personal or public level</p>
